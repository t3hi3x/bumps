OBDII Logging Server (TCP)
ECE495TUV - Spring 2010 VIP
#####################################
Make sure that the server is running before you attempt
to log any data with the iPhone app or it will not work.


#####################################
SERVER SETUP AND CONFIGURATION
#####################################

You may verify the servers operation by connecting via
Telnet.  The server expects data in the following, colon-
delimited format on a single line:

    log_id:obd_pid:data_bytes

If the data is valid, it will be decoded and logged to the
database.  If not, you should receive an error message.

Requirements:

* Java
* Jython
* JDBC Driver appropriate to your database server
	* Put these in the ./jar folder

NOTE: Due to licensing, no JDBC drivers are included in the source.

On a fresh install, use the scripts/*.sql file to rebuild
the database structure for your appropriate server.
